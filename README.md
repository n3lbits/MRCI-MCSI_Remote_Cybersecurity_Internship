# MCSI Remote Cybersecurity Internship (MRCI)
This repository serves to track my progress as I complete the MCSI Remote Cybersecurity Internship.

I have fortunately been invited to complete the Mosse Cybersecurity Institute Remote Internship, available to women and veterans at no cost. After completing SANS Cyber Academy and earning the GFACT, GSEC and GCIH certifications, this is a unique opportunity to keep working on building the necessary practical skills to support my ongoing development.

Upon successful completion of the program, the hands-on experience gained will further develop professional confidence, autonomy and creativity, thus resulting in a demonstrable skill-set to support my pursuit of employment. This is also foundational for ongoing development, professional engagement and ultimately contributing meaningful work as a valued member of the community.

The program is a highly unique, hands-on learning experience through a robust platform designed to develop and advance the practical skills and critical abilities that support real-world problem-solving, creative application and a constructive mindset.

The Remote Internship is comprised of the following 7 modules, beginning with the Lab Setup:

```
Module 1: Lab Setup
Module 2: Security Tools
Module 3: Penetration Testing
Module 4: Cyber Defense
Module 5: Threat Hunting
Module 6: Secure Software Development
Module 7: Red Teaming
```

As this is a work in progress, I will continue to update this readme and repo as I work through the program. I will provide further breakdown of the exercises within each module and track my completion accordingly.
